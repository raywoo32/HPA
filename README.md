## 2 STRING Data

The Human Protein Atlas (HPA) is a database that maps human proteins in cells, tissues and organs. HPA consists of 3 main components, the Tissue Atlas, the Cell Atlas and the Pathology Atlas. This package focuses on the normal tissue data from the Tissue Atlas which shows the distibution of genes across major tissues and organs in normal tissues. All data in HPA is open acess. 

This document describes work with [The Human Protein Atlas version 18.1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/) [(Uhl√©n M _et al._ 2015)](10.1126/science.1260419) 	
 
&nbsp;

#### 2.1 Data semantics

As stated above, the Tissue Atlas of HPA shows the localization of human proteins across numerous types of tissues and organs. The Tissue Altas annotated each gene with one of 44 different normal tissue types and organs and 76 different cell types. This gives a broad picture of localized protein expression. 

HPA obtains its data through manually analyzed RNA-seq expriments. For each gene, HPA uses experimental immunohistochemical staining profiles which are then computationally matched with mRNA data and gene/protein characterization data.

The data in HPA we will be using is the normal tissue dataset. This results in the tab-separated file we will be analyzing. This file includes: 

1. **Ensembl gene identifier
2. **Tissue name
3. **Annotated cell type
4. **Expression value 
5. **Gene reliability 

&nbsp;

## 3 Data download and cleanup

To download the source data from HPA ... :

1. Navigate to the [**Human Protein Atlas** database]https://www.proteinatlas.org/) and follow the link to the [download section](https://www.proteinatlas.org/download).
2. Download the following file:

* normal_tissue.tsv.zip (4.4 MB)

4. Uncompress the file and place it into a sister directory of your working directory which is called `data`. (It should be reachable with `file.path("..", "data")`).
&nbsp;

## 4 Mapping ENSEMBL IDs to HGNC symbols

The main information from HPA is the Ensemble gene ID and HGNC. This information can be used to find corresponding mRNA or proteins. We will build a map of Ensemble gene ID to HGNC to verify the dataset results, Ensemble gene ID to unique Ensemble peptide. 

&nbsp;

#### Preparations: packages, functions, files

To begin, we need to make sure the required packages are installed:

**`readr`** provides functions to read data which are particularly suitable for
large datasets. They are much faster than the built-in read.csv() etc. But caution: these functions return "tibbles", not data frames. ([Know the difference](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tibble/vignettes/tibble.html).)
```R
if (! requireNamespace("readr")) {
  install.packages("readr")
}
```

**`biomaRt`** biomaRt is a Bioconductor package that implements the RESTful API of biomart,
the annotation framwork for model organism genomes at the EBI. It is a Bioconductor package, and as such it needs to be loaded via the **`BiocManager`**,
&nbsp;

```R
if (! requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("BiocManager")
}
if (! requireNamespace("biomaRt", quietly = TRUE)) {
  BiocManager::install("biomaRt")
}
```

**`igraph`** is THE go-to package for everything graph related. We use it here to
compute some statistics on the STRING- and example graphs and plot.
&nbsp;

```R
if (! requireNamespace("igraph")) {
  install.packages("igraph")
}
```

**`stringi`** is a package for string manipulation. We use stri_isempty(). 
&nbsp;
```R
if (! requireNamespace("stringi") {
  install.packages("igraph")
}
```


&nbsp;

Next we source a utility function that we will use later, for mapping
ENSP IDs to gene symbols if the mapping can not be achieved directly.

&nbsp;

```R

source("inst/scripts/recoverIDs.R")

```

&nbsp;

Finally we fetch the HGNC reference data from GitHub. The `recoverIDs()` function requires the `HGNC` object to be available in the global namespace. (Nb. This shows how to load `.RData` files directly from a GitHub repository!)

&nbsp;

```R
myURL <- paste0("https://github.com/hyginn/",
                "BCB420-2019-resources/blob/master/HGNC.RData?raw=true")
load(url(myURL))  # loads HGNC data frame

```
&nbsp;

#### 4.1 Step one: which IDs do we have to map?

&nbsp;

```R
  # Read in original data format 
  
  tmp <- readr::read_tsv(file.path("../data", "normal_tissue.tsv"),
                         skip = 1, #skip gets rid of header
                         col_names = c("ENSG", "HGNC", "Tissue", "Cell Type",
                                       "Level", "Reliability"))  # 1 053 330 rows
  

  # tmp is in the following format 
  # <ENSG> <HGNC> <Tissue> <Cell Type> <Level> Reliability> 

  # how many unique IDs do we have to map?
  uniqueENSG <- unique(tmp$ENSG)  # 13,206 elements

```

&nbsp;

#### 4.2  Step two: mapping via biomaRt

To proceed with the mapping, we use biomaRt to fetch as many HGNC symbols as we can - first in bulk (mapping ENSP IDs to HGNC symbols), then individually for the remaining IDs we could not map, via UniProt IDs, RefSeq IDs or UCSC IDs. We also load the HGNC reference data to validate our results.

&nbsp;

###### 4.2.1  Constructing an ID-mapping tool


But what does an ID mapping tool look like anyway? It is a named vector, in which the elements are the IDs we need to map to, and the names are the IDs we are mapping from. Consider the following example:

```R
up2low <- letters
names(up2low) <- LETTERS
up2low[24] <- NA  # replaxe "x" with NA
x <- c("A", "G", "1234", "c", "T", "X")
up2low[x]
#  A    G   <NA> <NA>  T    X
# "a"  "g"   NA   NA  "t"   NA

```
Note:

1. Every element (ID) whose name appears in the `names()` gets replaced by the element (ID) in the vector itself (A -> a, G -> G, T -> t);
2. If the element **does not** appear in the `names()`, (e.g. "1234", "c") it gets replaced by `NA`.
3. Some IDs can not get mapped - like "X" in the example, these *could* be missing, but for bookkeeping purposes and for efficiency it is better to have them present and map them to `NA`.

Therefore: a good ID mapping tool contains as many mappings as possible for the target set, and every ID of the source set should be present and unique. Incidentally, uniqueness is structurally enforced: in R, names, rownames and colnames have to be unique in the first place.

Since the Dataset already comes with HGNC, I found the protein IDs and entrezgene IDs for this dataset.

&nbsp;

```R

  # Map ENSP to HGNC symbols: open a "Mart" object ..
  myMart <- biomaRt::useMart("ensembl", dataset="hsapiens_gene_ensembl")

  ensg2ensp <- biomaRt::getBM(filters = "ensembl_gene_id",
                             attributes = c("ensembl_gene_id",
                                            "ensembl_peptide_id"),
                             values = uniqueENSG,
                             mart = myMart)

  colnames(ensg&enspc) <- c("ENSG", "ENSP")

  head(tmp)
  #    ENSG            HGNC   Tissue        `Cell Type`         Level        Reliability
  #   <chr>           <chr>  <chr>         <chr>               <chr>        <chr>      
  #1  ENSG00000000003 TSPAN6 adrenal gland glandular cells     Not detected Approved   
  #2  ENSG00000000003 TSPAN6 appendix      glandular cells     Medium       Approved   
  #3  ENSG00000000003 TSPAN6 appendix      lymphoid tissue     Not detected Approved   
  #4  ENSG00000000003 TSPAN6 bone marrow   hematopoietic cells Not detected Approved   
  #5  ENSG00000000003 TSPAN6 breast        adipocytes          Not detected Approved   
  #6  ENSG00000000003 TSPAN6 breast        glandular cells     High         Approved   

  # check values
  any(is.na(ensg2ensp$ENSG)) # FALSE
  any(is.na(ensg2ensp$ENSP)) # FALSE
  nrow(ensg2ensp)            # 8 4684
  length(unique(ensg2ensp$ENSG))  # 13 199
  length(unique(ensg2ensp$ENSP))   # 13 199

  nrow(tmp)  # 19,109  symbols have been retrieved for the 19,354 ENSP IDs.
  
```
&nbsp;

There are three possible problems with the data that biomart returns:

&nbsp;

**(1)** There might be more than one value returned. The ID appears more than
once in `tmp$ensembl_peptide_id`, with different mapped symbols.

```R
  sum(duplicated(tmp$ENSG))  # Indeed: three duplicates!
  sum(duplicated(ensg2HGNC$ENSG))
```

&nbsp;

**(2)** There might be nothing returned for one ENSP ID. We have the ID in `uENSP`, but it does not appear in `tmp$ensembl_peptide_id`:

```R

  sum(! (uENSP) %in% tmp$ensembl_peptide_id)  # 248
```
&nbsp;

**(3)** There might be no value returned: `NA`, or `""`. The ID appears in `tmp$ensembl_peptide_id`, but there is no symbol in `tmp$hgnc_symbol`.

```R
  sum(is.na(ensp2sym$sym))  # 0
  sum(ensp2sym$sym == "")   # 199 - note: empty strings for absent symbols.
```

&nbsp;

Let's fix the "duplicates" problem first. We can't have duplicates: if we encounter an ENSP ID, we need exactly one symbol assigned to it. What are these genes?

&nbsp;

```R

  dupEnsp <- tmp$ensembl_peptide_id[duplicated(tmp$ensembl_peptide_id)]
  tmp[tmp$ensembl_peptide_id %in% dupEnsp, ]

  #                  ensp      sym
  # 8668  ENSP00000344961  PLEKHG7
  # 8669  ENSP00000344961 C12orf74
  # 14086 ENSP00000380933  PLEKHG7
  # 14087 ENSP00000380933 C12orf74
  # 18419 ENSP00000480558   CCL3L3
  # 18420 ENSP00000480558   CCL3L1

  # ENSP00000380933 and ENSP00000344961 should both map to PLEKHG7
  # CCL3L3 and CCL3L3 both have UniProt ID P16619, we map ENSP00000480558
  # (arbitrarily) to CCL3L1

  # validate target rows
  tmp[tmp$hgnc_symbol %in% c("C12orf74", "CCL3L3"), ]

  # remove target rows
  tmp <- tmp[ ! (tmp$hgnc_symbol %in% c("C12orf74", "CCL3L3")), ]

  # check result
  any(duplicated(tmp$ensembl_peptide_id))   # now FALSE
```

&nbsp;

After this preliminary cleanup, defining the mapping tool is simple:

&nbsp;

```R
  ensp2sym <- tmp$hgnc_symbol
  names(ensp2sym) <- tmp$ensembl_peptide_id
  
  head(ensp2sym)
  # ENSP00000216487 ENSP00000075120 ENSP00000209884  
  #        "RIN3"        "SLC2A3"        "KLHL20"   
  #        
  # ENSP00000046087 ENSP00000205214 ENSP00000167106
  #      "ZPBP"         "AASDH"         "VASH1"

```

&nbsp;

###### 4.2.2  Cleanup and validation of `ensp2sym`

There are two types of IDs we need to process further: (1), those that were not returned at all from biomaRt, (2) those for which only an empty string was returned.

First, we add the symbols that were not returned by biomaRt to the map. They are present in uENSP, but not in ensp2sym$ensp:

&nbsp;

```R
  sel <- ! (uENSP %in% names(ensp2sym))
  x <- rep(NA, sum( sel))
  names(x) <- uENSP[ sel ]

  # confirm uniqueness
  any(duplicated(c(names(x), names(ensp2sym))))  # FALSE

  # concatenate the two vectors
  ensp2sym <- c(ensp2sym, x)

  # confirm
  all(uENSP %in% names(ensp2sym))  # TRUE
```

&nbsp;

Next, we set the symbols for which only an empty string was returned to `NA`:

&nbsp;

```R
  sel <- which(ensp2sym == "") # 199 elements
  ensp2sym[head(sel)] # before ...
  ensp2sym[sel] <- NA
  ensp2sym[head(sel)] # ... after

  # Do we still have all ENSP IDs accounted for?
  all( uENSP %in% names(ensp2sym))  # TRUE

```

&nbsp;

###### 4.2.3  Additional symbols

A function for using biomaRt for more detailed mapping is in the file `inst/scripts/recoverIds.R`. We have loaded it previously, and use it on all elements of `ensp2sym` that are `NA`.

&nbsp;

```R

  # How many NAs are there in "ensp2sym" column?
  sum(is.na(ensp2sym))   # 447

  # subset the ENSP IDs
  unmappedENSP <- names(ensp2sym)[is.na(ensp2sym)]

  # use our function recoverIDs() to try and map the unmapped ensp IDs
  # to symboils via other cross-references
  recoveredENSP <- recoverIDs(unmappedENSP)

  # how many did we find
  nrow(recoveredENSP)  # 11. Not much, but it's honest work.

  # add the recovered symbols to ensp2sym
  ensp2sym[recoveredENSP$ensp] <- recoveredENSP$sym

  # validate:
  sum(is.na(ensp2sym))  # 436 - 11 less than 447

```

&nbsp;

#### 4.4  Step four: outdated symbols

We now have each unique ENSP IDs represented once in our mapping table. But are these the correct symbols? Or did biomaRt return obsolete names for some? We need to compare the symbols to our reference data and try to fix any problems. Symbols that do not appear in the reference table will also be set to NA.

&nbsp;

```R
  # are all symbols present in the reference table?
  sel <- ( ! (ensp2sym %in% HGNC$sym)) & ( ! (is.na(ensp2sym)))
  length(        ensp2sym[ sel ] )  # 137 unknown
  length( unique(ensp2sym[ sel ]))  # they are all unique

  # put these symbols in a new dataframe
  unkSym <- data.frame(unk = ensp2sym[ sel ],
                       new = NA,
                       stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

  # Inspect:
  # several of these are formatted like "TNFSF12-TNFSF13" or "TMED7-TICAM2".
  # This looks like biomaRt concatenated symbol names.
  grep("TNFSF12", HGNC$sym) # 23984: TNFSF12
  grep("TNFSF13", HGNC$sym) # 23985 23986: TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B
  grep("TMED7",   HGNC$sym) # 23630: TMED7
  grep("TICAM2",  HGNC$sym) # 23494: TICAM2

  # It's not clear why this happened. We will take a conservative approach
  # and not make assumptions which of the two symbols is the correct one,
  # i.e. we will leave these symbols as NA


  # grep() for the presence of the symbols in either HGNC$prev or
  # HGNC$synonym. If either is found, that symbol replaces NA in unkSym$new
  for (i in seq_len(nrow(unkSym))) {
    iPrev <- grep(unkSym$unk[i], HGNC$prev)[1] # take No. 1 if there are several
    if (length(iPrev) == 1) {
      unkSym$new[i] <- HGNC$sym[iPrev]
    } else {
      iSynonym <- which(grep(unkSym$unk[i], HGNC$synonym))[1]
      if (length(iSynonym) == 1) {
        unkSym$new[i] <- HGNC$sym[iSynonym]
      }
    }
  }

  # How many did we find?
  sum(! is.na(unkSym$new))  # 32

  # We add the contents of unkSym$new back into ensp2sym. This way, the
  # newly mapped symbols are updated, and the old symbols that did not
  # map are set to NA.

  ensp2sym[rownames(unkSym)] <- unkSym$new


```

#### 4.5 Final validation

Validation and statistics of our mapping tool:

```R

# do we now have all ENSP IDs mapped?
all(uENSP %in% names(ensp2sym))  # TRUE

# how many symbols did we find?
sum(! is.na(ensp2sym))  # 18845

# (in %)
sum(! is.na(ensp2sym)) * 100 / length(ensp2sym)  # 96.0 %

# are all symbols current in our reference table?
all(ensp2sym[! is.na(ensp2sym)] %in% HGNC$sym)  # TRUE

# Done.
# This concludes construction of our mapping tool.
# Save the map:

save(ensp2sym, file = file.path("inst", "extdata", "ensp2sym.RData"))

# From an RStudio project, the file can be loaded with
load(file = file.path("inst", "extdata", "ensp2sym.RData"))


```

&nbsp;

# 5 Annotating gene sets with STRING Data

Given our mapping tool, we can now annotate gene sets with STRING data. As a first example, we analyze the entire STRING graph. Next, we use high-confidence edges to analyze the network of our example gene set.


&nbsp;

```R

# Read the interaction graph data: this is a weighted graph defined as an
# edge list with gene a, gene b, confidence score (0, 999).

tmp <- readr::read_delim(file.path("../data", "9606.protein.links.v11.0.txt"),
                         delim = " ",
                         skip = 1,
                         col_names = c("a", "b", "score"))  # 11,759,454 rows

# do they all have the right tax id?
all(grepl("^9606\\.", tmp$a))  # TRUE
all(grepl("^9606\\.", tmp$b))  # TRUE
# remove "9606." prefix
tmp$a <- gsub("^9606\\.", "", tmp$a)
tmp$b <- gsub("^9606\\.", "", tmp$b)

# how are the scores distributed?

minScore <- 0
maxScore <- 1000
# we define breaks to lie just below the next full number
hist(tmp$score[(tmp$score >= minScore) & (tmp$score <= maxScore)],
     xlim = c(minScore, maxScore),
     breaks = c((seq(minScore, (maxScore - 25), by = 25) - 0.1), maxScore),
     main = "STRING edge scores",
     col = colorRampPalette(c("#FFFFFF","#8888A6","#FF6655"), bias = 2)(40),
     xlab = "scores: (p * 1,000)",
     ylab = "p",
     xaxt = "n")
axis(1, at = seq(minScore, maxScore, by = 100))
abline(v = 900, lwd = 0.5)

```

![](./inst/img/score_hist_1.svg?sanitize=true "STRING score distribution")

We know that "channel 7 - databases" interactions are arbitrarily scored as _p_ = 0.9. This is clearly reflected in the scores distribution.

```R
# Zoom in

minScore <- 860
maxScore <- 1000
hist(tmp$score[(tmp$score >= minScore) & (tmp$score <= maxScore)],
     xlim = c(minScore, maxScore),
     breaks = c((seq(minScore, (maxScore - 4), by = 4) - 0.1), maxScore),
     main = "STRING edge scores",
     col = colorRampPalette(c("#FFFFFF","#8888A6","#FF6655"), bias = 1.2)(35),
     xlab = "scores: (p * 1,000)",
     ylab = "p",
     xaxt = "n")
axis(1, at = seq(minScore, maxScore, by = 10))
abline(v = 900, lwd = 0.5)

```

![](./inst/img/score_hist_2.svg?sanitize=true "STRING score distribution (detail)")


```R

# Focus on the cutoff of scores at p == 0.9
sum(tmp$score >= 880 & tmp$score < 890) # 5,706
sum(tmp$score >= 890 & tmp$score < 900) # 5,666
sum(tmp$score >= 900 & tmp$score < 910) # 315,010
sum(tmp$score >= 910 & tmp$score < 920) # 83,756

# We shall restrict our dataset to high-confidence edges with p >= 0.9

tmp <- tmp[tmp$score >= 900, ]  # 648,304 rows of high-confidence edges

```

&nbsp;

Are these edges duplicated? I.e. are there (a, b) and (b, a) edges in the dataset? The common way to test for that is to created a composite string of the two elements, sorted. Thus if we have an edge betwween `"this"` and `"that"`, and an edge between `"that"` and `"this"`, these edges both get mapped to a key `"that:this"` - and the duplication is easy to recognize.

&nbsp;

```R

sPaste <- function(x, collapse = ":") {
  return(paste(sort(x), collapse = collapse))
}
tmp$key <- apply(tmp[ , c("a", "b")], 1, sPaste)

length(tmp$key) # 648,304
length(unique(tmp$key)) # 324,152  ... one half of the edges are duplicates!

# We can remove those edges. And the keys.
tmp <- tmp[( ! duplicated(tmp$key)), c("a", "b", "score") ]
```

&nbsp;

Finally we map the ENSP IDs to HGNC symbols. Using our tool, this is a simple assignment:

&nbsp;

```R

tmp$a <- ensp2sym[tmp$a]
tmp$b <- ensp2sym[tmp$b]

# Validate:
# how many rows could not be mapped
any(grepl("ENSP", tmp$a))  # Nope
any(grepl("ENSP", tmp$b))  # None left here either
sum(is.na(tmp$a)) # 705
sum(is.na(tmp$b)) # 3501

# we remove edges in which either one or the other node is NA to
# create our final data:
STRINGedges <- tmp[( ! is.na(tmp$a)) & ( ! is.na(tmp$b)), ] # 319,997 edges

# Done.
# Save result
save(STRINGedges, file = file.path("..", "data", "STRINGedges.RData"))
# That's only 1.4 MB actually.

```

&nbsp;

#### 5 Network statistics

Simple characterization of network statistics:

&nbsp;

```R

# number of nodes
(N <- length(unique(c(STRINGedges$a, STRINGedges$b))))  # 12,196 genes

# coverage of human protein genes
N * 100 / sum(HGNC$type == "protein")  # 63.4 %

# number of edges
nrow(STRINGedges)   # 319,997

## 6 Biological validation: network properties

For more detailed validation, we need to look at network properties 

&nbsp;

```R

sG <- igraph::graph_from_edgelist(matrix(c(STRINGedges$a,
                                           STRINGedges$b),
                                         ncol = 2,
                                         byrow = FALSE),
                                  directed = FALSE)

# degree distribution
dg <- igraph::degree(sG)

# is this a scale-free distribution? Plot log(rank) vs. log(frequency)
freqRank <- table(dg)
x <- log10(as.numeric(names(freqRank)) + 1)
y <- log10(as.numeric(freqRank))
plot(x, y,
     type = "b",
     pch = 21, bg = "#A5F5CC",
     xlab = "log(Rank)", ylab = "log(frequency)",
     main = "Zipf's law governing the STRING network")

# Regression line
ab <- lm(y ~ x)
abline(ab, col = "#FF000077", lwd = 0.7)

```

![](./inst/img/STRING_Zipf_plot_1.svg?sanitize=true "STRING score distribution (detail)")


```R
# What are the ten highest degree nodes?
x <- sort(dg, decreasing = TRUE)[1:10]
cat(sprintf("\t%d:\t%s\t(%s)\n", x, names(x), HGNC[names(x), "name"]))
# 1343:	RPS27A	(ribosomal protein S27a)

## 7 Annotation of the example gene set

To conclude, we annotate the example gene set, validate the annotation, and store the data in an edge-list format.

&nbsp;

```R

# The specification of the sample set is copy-paste from the 
# BCB420 resources project.

xSet <- c("AMBRA1", "ATG14", "ATP2A1", "ATP2A2", "ATP2A3", "BECN1", "BECN2",
          "BIRC6", "BLOC1S1", "BLOC1S2", "BORCS5", "BORCS6", "BORCS7",
          "BORCS8", "CACNA1A", "CALCOCO2", "CTTN", "DCTN1", "EPG5", "GABARAP",
          "GABARAPL1", "GABARAPL2", "HDAC6", "HSPB8", "INPP5E", "IRGM",
          "KXD1", "LAMP1", "LAMP2", "LAMP3", "LAMP5", "MAP1LC3A", "MAP1LC3B",
          "MAP1LC3C", "MGRN1", "MYO1C", "MYO6", "NAPA", "NSF", "OPTN",
          "OSBPL1A", "PI4K2A", "PIK3C3", "PLEKHM1", "PSEN1", "RAB20", "RAB21",
          "RAB29", "RAB34", "RAB39A", "RAB7A", "RAB7B", "RPTOR", "RUBCN",
          "RUBCNL", "SNAP29", "SNAP47", "SNAPIN", "SPG11", "STX17", "STX6",
          "SYT7", "TARDBP", "TFEB", "TGM2", "TIFA", "TMEM175", "TOM1",
          "TPCN1", "TPCN2", "TPPP", "TXNIP", "UVRAG", "VAMP3", "VAMP7",
          "VAMP8", "VAPA", "VPS11", "VPS16", "VPS18", "VPS33A", "VPS39",
          "VPS41", "VTI1B", "YKT6")

# which example genes are not among the known nodes?
x <- which( ! (xSet %in% c(STRINGedges$a, STRINGedges$b)))
cat(sprintf("\t%s\t(%s)\n", HGNC[xSet[x], "sym"], HGNC[xSet[x], "name"]))

# BECN2	(beclin 2)
# EPG5	(ectopic P-granules autophagy protein 5 homolog)
# LAMP3	(lysosomal associated membrane protein 3)
# LAMP5	(lysosomal associated membrane protein family member 5)
# PLEKHM1	(pleckstrin homology and RUN domain containing M1)
# RUBCNL	(rubicon like autophagy enhancer)
# TIFA	(TRAF interacting protein with forkhead associated domain)
# TMEM175	(transmembrane protein 175)
# TPCN1	(two pore segment channel 1)
# TPCN2	(two pore segment channel 2)

# That make sense - generally fewer interactions have been recorded for
# membrane proteins.


# For our annotation, we select edges for which both nodes are part of the
# example set:
sel <- (STRINGedges$a %in% xSet) & (STRINGedges$b %in% xSet)
xSetEdges <- STRINGedges[sel, c("a", "b")]
# Statistics:
nrow(xSetEdges)   # 206

# Save the annotated set

writeLines(c("a\tb",
             sprintf("%s\t%s", xSetEdges$a, xSetEdges$b)),
           con = "xSetEdges.tsv")

# The data set can be read back in again (in an RStudio session) with
myXset <- read.delim(file.path("inst", "extdata", "xSetEdges.tsv"),
                     stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# From an installed package, the command would be:
myXset <- read.delim(system.file("extdata",
                                  "xSetEdges.tsv",
                                  package = "BCB420.2019.STRING"),
                     stringsAsFactors = FALSE)


# confirm
nrow(myXset) # 206
colnames(myXset) == c("a", "b") # TRUE TRUE

```

Example code for biomaRt was taken taken from `BIN-PPI-Analysis.R` and example code for work with igraph was taken from `FND-MAT-Graphs_and_networks.R`, both in the [ABC-Units project](https://github.com/hyginn/ABC-units) (Steipe, 2016-1019). A preliminary version of a STRING import script was written as [starter code for the 2018 BCB BioHacks Hackathon](https://github.com/hyginn/ABC-units) at the UNiversity of Toronto (Steipe, 2018) - this script draws on the former.
